### Always Remember:
Focus on What Matters – the year before, he became one of the biggest proponents of climate change, saying that "there could be a direct link between carbon dioxide emissions and increases in the severity of hurricanes, snowfall, flooding, and other natural catastrophes."

By the end of the century, however, Hansen's model shows that rising temperatures were responsible for about 15 percent of the warming since 1900, about double how quickly that trend began. This led him, later, to argue in the 2005 Nobel committee, that "the evidence suggests that we didn't see more of the major change over the next 10 or 20 years from natural increases to increases in global temperatures at the same time, and so, what we saw was largely unprecedented changes — including that of recent years" (emphasis added).

Yet this is how a climate model based on warming is produced, he argued in 2004, a century after he made climate change a central part of his work.

"If we look at the rate of change over the past 100 decades," Hansen said to a news conference, "we get a clear, clear message that the recent increase in global temperatures is an artifact of human behavior. The record is clear that human activity has continued to contribute significantly to climate change."

But that doesn't happen in this long-term.

Now and then he cites some evidence. For example, in 2012 Hansen said a study at the University of Copenhagen showed that, in the case
